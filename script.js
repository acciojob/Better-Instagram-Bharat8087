Selection of Elements: You have correctly selected all the draggable elements using document.querySelectorAll('.draggable').

Storing the Source Element: In the handleDragStart function, you’re storing the source element (the element being dragged) in dragSrcEl. This is correct.

Setting the Data Transfer: Still in the handleDragStart function, you’re correctly setting the data to be transferred (the id of the element being dragged) using e.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', this.id).

Handling Drag Over: In the handleDragOver function, you’re correctly preventing the browser’s default handling of the data and setting the drop effect to ‘move’.

Handling Drop: In the handleDrop function, you’re doing several things:

Stopping the browser from redirecting.
Checking if the source element is not the same as the target element.
If the above check passes, you’re swapping the background images of the source and target elements.
Cleaning Up: In the handleDragEnd function, you’re removing the ‘over’ class from all draggable elements.

Adding Event Listeners: Finally, you’re correctly adding event listeners for the dragstart, dragover, drop, and dragend events to all draggable elements.

Remember, the main goal is to allow the user to drag and drop the divs, swapping their background images in the process.
